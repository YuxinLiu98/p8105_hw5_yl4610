# problem 2

``` r
homicide_raw = read_csv( "./data/homicide_data.csv") 
```

This dataset contains variables such as uid, reported_date, victim_last,
victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city, state, lat,
lon, disposition. It contains 12 columns and 52179 rows.

``` r
homicide = 
homicide_raw %>% 
  mutate (
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    city_state = ifelse(city_state == "Tulsa, AL", "Tulsa, OK", city_state)) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition !="Closed by arrest"))

homicide
```

I used mutate to create a city_state variable. Then I used group_by and
summarize to summarize within cities to obtain the total number of
homicides and the number of unsolved homicides.

``` r
baltimore = 
  homicide %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") 

prop.test(
  baltimore$unsolved_homicides,baltimore$total_homicides) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

I used filter to filter out other city_state except “Baltimore, MD”.
Then I used prop.test function to estimate the proportion of homicides
that are unsolved and applied the broom::tidy to pull the estimated
proportion and confidence intervals.
