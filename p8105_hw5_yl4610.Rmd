This dataset contains variables such as `r names(homicide_raw)`. It contains `r ncol(homicide_raw)` columns and `r nrow(homicide_raw)` rows. 

```{r, results='hide'}
homicide = 
homicide_raw %>% 
  mutate (
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    city_state = ifelse(city_state == "Tulsa, AL", "Tulsa, OK", city_state)) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition !="Closed by arrest"))
